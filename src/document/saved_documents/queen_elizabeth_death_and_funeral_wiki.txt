On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.

The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.

Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family.

The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]

Background
Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]

In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.[8][9] Her symptoms were described as mild and cold-like, and she later commented that the disease "does leave one very tired and exhausted".[10][11] The monarch's health became a cause of concern to commentators at this time.[12][13]

The Queen was said to be feeling well enough to resume her official duties by 1 March 2022 and attended the service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey on 29 March.[14][15] Despite this, the Queen did not attend several appointments over the following months due to "episodic mobility problems", including the annual Commonwealth Day service in March, the Royal Maundy service in April, the State Opening of Parliament in May, and the National Service of Thanksgiving for her Platinum Jubilee in June.[16][17][18][19] During the Jubilee the Queen also suffered "discomfort" after standing during Trooping the Colour and was largely confined to balcony appearances during the celebrations.[20] According to her apothecary in Scotland, Dr Douglas Glass, there had been private concerns about her health for several months before her death; he was quoted in a later biography as saying "It was expected and we were quite aware of what was going to happen."[21]

Two days before her death, on 6 September 2022, the Queen accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson and appointed Liz Truss to succeed him as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; these meetings took place at Balmoral Castle, rather than their usual location, Buckingham Palace.[22] At the meeting with Truss, the final public photos of the Queen were taken by Jane Barlow. Social media users were quick to observe the Queen’s continued use of a walking stick, her frail, “ghostly” appearance, and a large bruise-like mark on her right hand. After the Queen’s death, Barlow said that while she could tell the Queen was unwell, she was “in quite good spirits.” On 7 September, the Queen was scheduled to attend an online meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom to swear in new ministers in Truss's government, but this was cancelled after she was advised by doctors to rest.[23] The Queen's final public statement, issued that same day, was a message of condolences for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24]

Death and national mourning
Death and announcement
Queen Elizabeth Death Certificate
Death certificate issued for Elizabeth II
The Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96, ending her 70-year reign. According to her death certificate, which was made public on 29 September, she died of old age.[2] Her death was publicly announced at 18:30.[25][26] Elizabeth II was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542.[27][28]

Members of the royal family travelled to Balmoral Castle throughout the day. Prince Charles arrived at 10:30 and was met by Princess Anne, who was already staying with the Queen.[29][30] Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, also travelled to Balmoral from the Birkhall estate.[29] Only Charles and Anne were by the Queen's side when she died.[29][31] Prince William, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, left RAF Northolt on a flight to Aberdeen Airport and arrived at Balmoral shortly after 17:00; Prince Harry, who had travelled alone and departed later than the other family members, arrived at Balmoral at 20:00; Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, did not join them.[29][30][32][33][34]

Prime Minister Liz Truss is believed to have been informed of the Queen's declining health that morning by the Cabinet secretary, Simon Case, and received an update at 12:00.[35][36] The Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, was informed by a note passed to him by Deputy Leader Angela Rayner during a speech he was giving in the House of Commons.[a][37][38][39] At 12:30 Buckingham Palace made a public announcement expressing concern for the Queen's health; the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, made a brief statement of good wishes in response.[b][38][40][41]

Truss was informed at 16:30 that the Queen had died, and the royal family announced her death two hours later via newswires and a post on Twitter.[c][42][43][44][45] A notice with the same statement was affixed to the railings outside Buckingham Palace and posted on the royal family website.[46]

BBC One continuously covered the Queen's condition from 12:40, after the first official statement; special reports were also run on ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5.[47][48] British television announcements of the Queen's death began at 18:31, when news presenter Huw Edwards read the royal family's statement during a live broadcast on the BBC News channel and BBC One. At 18:32 the presenters of BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 5 Live made similar announcements.[48] At around 18:36 all BBC Radio stations had interrupted programming with a news report read by Chris Aldridge to announce the Queen's death.[49]

After the announcement, the Union Flags at Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street were lowered to half-mast.[50][51] At Balmoral Castle, the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom was lowered and then, because the new king was present, was raised again. The Royal Banner of Scotland was lowered to half-mast at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, as was the Welsh flag at Cardiff Castle.[51][52] Crowds gathered outside royal residences, and rainbows were seen above Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.[53]

At 13:00 the next day, 9 September, a death gun salute of 96 rounds representing the years of the Queen's life were fired by the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery in Hyde Park, London, by the Honourable Artillery Company at the Tower of London and by 105th Regiment Royal Artillery at Edinburgh Castle. Simultaneous salutes were fired at British Army garrisons at Belfast, Cardiff, York, Colchester, Stirling, Gibraltar and Larkhill;[54] also on Royal Navy warships at sea and at naval bases.[55]

Scottish events
As the Queen died in Scotland, this meant that Operation Unicorn was the first part of Operation London Bridge to take effect.[56] Her body was taken to Edinburgh, where ceremonies were held, then to London for the state funeral.

The Queen's coffin left Balmoral Castle at 10:46 on 11 September, draped with the Scottish version of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom and topped with a wreath of flowers from the castle gardens.[d][57][58] The journey of the cortege, which included Princess Anne and Sir Timothy Laurence, was 175 miles (282 km) long and passed through Aberdeenshire, Aberdeen, Angus, Dundee, Perth and Kinross, and Fife.[59][60] People lined the route of the cortege to pay their respects, and in Aberdeenshire farmers formed a guard of honour of tractors.[61][62] The cortege reached the Palace of Holyroodhouse at 16:23 and the coffin was placed in the Throne Room.[59][60][63] The coffin was made from oak and was lined with lead, reportedly weighing 245 kg (540 lb).[64]


The Queen's coffin arrives in Edinburgh on 11 September
On 12 September the Queen's coffin was carried up the Royal Mile to St Giles' Cathedral, in a procession that included King Charles, Princess Anne and Timothy Laurence, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward, the Bearer Party from the Royal Regiment of Scotland, and the Royal Company of Archers.[63][65][66][67] Queen Camilla and Sophie the Countess of Wessex and Forfar followed closely in their car.[68] Guns were fired every minute from Edinburgh Castle during the procession.[65] On arrival the coffin was carried into the cathedral, and the Crown of Scotland was placed on it.[69]

A service of thanksgiving was then held to celebrate the Queen's life and to highlight her association with Scotland.[70][65][66] The service was led by the minister of St Giles' Cathedral, the Reverend Calum Macleod, and the homily given by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Reverend Dr Iain Greenshields.[e][72] Psalm 118 was sung in Gaelic by Karen Matheson.[73] It was attended by the royal party; politicians, including Liz Truss and Nicola Sturgeon; and representatives from the Queen's Scottish charities and organisations.[65]

The Queen's coffin lay at rest at the cathedral for 24 hours, guarded by the Royal Company of Archers, which allowed around 33,000 people to file past the coffin.[70][74] In the evening King Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, and Prince Edward held a vigil at the cathedral, a custom known as the Vigil of the Princes; Princess Anne was the first woman to participate.[70][75]

On 13 September Elizabeth's coffin was taken by hearse to Edinburgh Airport and flown to RAF Northolt on a Royal Air Force C-17 Globemaster, accompanied by Princess Anne and Sir Timothy Laurence.[76] The Royal Air Force Bearer Party carried the coffin onto the aircraft and a Guard of Honour was formed by the Royal Regiment of Scotland.[77] During the journey the Scottish version of the Royal Standard that draped the coffin was replaced by the Royal Standard that is used in the rest of the United Kingdom.[78]

Lying-in-state
Upon the Queen's arrival in London, she was transported to Buckingham Palace, before being moved to Westminster Hall the following day for her lying-in-state before the state funeral.

When the Queen arrived at RAF Northolt the Queen's Colour Squadron (63 Squadron RAF Regiment) assumed the role of the Bearer Party and formed the Guard of Honour.[77] The coffin was placed in the state hearse and transported through London to Buckingham Palace, with people lining the street to watch.[77][79] The coffin was then placed in the Bow Room at Buckingham Palace in the presence of the royal family.[f][79][80]

The Queen's coffin was taken in a military procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on a horse-drawn gun carriage of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.[g] The King, male members of the royal family, and Princess Anne followed the coffin on foot.[h][81][82][83] This procession, as well the other processions held later in London and Windsor, marched at the funeral pace of 75 steps per minute and was accompanied by military bands playing marches by Johann Heinrich Walch, Felix Mendelssohn and Frédéric Chopin.[84][81][85] Big Ben tolled each minute of the procession and minute guns were fired from Hyde Park by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.[81][86]

Members of the three armed forces formed a guard of honour to receive the coffin at Parliament Square, after which soldiers from the Queen's Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, placed the coffin on a catafalque in Westminster Hall.[81] The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Dean of Westminster then conducted a service in the presence of the royal family.[70]

Elizabeth II lying-in-state at Westminster Hall
The Queen lay in state in Westminster Hall from 17:00 on 14 September to 06:30 on 19 September.[70] The coffin was guarded by members of both the Sovereign's Bodyguard[i] and the Household Division.[j][k] The Imperial State Crown and a wreath of flowers and foliage from Balmoral and Windsor castles had been placed on the coffin before the procession, and to these were added the Sovereign's Orb and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross; the Wanamaker Cross of Westminster was placed at its head and the regimental flag of The Queen's Company of The Grenadier Guards at its foot.[88][89] An estimated 250,000 members of the public filed past the coffin, as did politicians and other public figures.[90][91] Both the BBC and ITV offered a livestream of the Queen lying-in-state.[92][93] On 16 September, a 28-year-old man was arrested under the Public Order Act after he ran from the queue inside Westminster Hall and touched the coffin.[94][95]

In the evening of 16 September the King and his siblings held a vigil around the Queen's coffin for approximately ten minutes, and on 17 September the Queen's eight grandchildren did the same.[96][97] Prince Andrew and Prince Harry were permitted to wear military uniform on these occasions, who as non-working royals had not done at previous ceremonial events.[98][99][96]

On 18 September, pipers at four different locations in Scotland played "The Immortal Memory" at 18:00.[100] At 20:00 a minute's silence was observed across the UK.[101]

The Queue

Two queues were formed to view the lying-in-state, beginning 48 hours before Westminster Hall opened to the public.[102] At its maximum extent the main queue was approximately 10 miles (16 km) long and had a waiting time of over 25 hours.[103][104] This queue attracted much media attention, with many commentators noting the stereotype that British people are good at queueing.[105][106][107][108] The accessible queue, for people with a disability or long-term condition, operated a ticket system and was therefore shorter.[109]

The queue experience was generally perceived to be positive, however there was an allegation of a man committing sexual assault by exposing himself, and some heckling of queuers.[110][111][112] The London Ambulance Service also had to assist 710 people, mainly due to head injuries from fainting.[113][114]

State funeral
Planning

Plans for the Queen's death had existed in some form since the 1960s, and the Queen was consulted about all the details included in her funeral plan.[115][116] The earl marshal was in charge of organising the event.[116]

The planning and complexity of the funeral was compared to that of Winston Churchill in 1965, the last state funeral held in Britain and also a major international event.[117][118][119][120] It marked the first time that a monarch's funeral service had been held at Westminster Abbey since George II in 1760.[118][121] The Foreign Office handled the invitations, communications, and security arrangements from a headquarters called "The Hangar", redeploying 300 staff to manage the task.[122] Approximately 500 foreign dignitaries and heads of state were expected to attend. Invitations were issued to every country with which Britain maintains diplomatic relations, except for Russia, Belarus, and Myanmar; Syria, Venezuela and Afghanistan were not invited.[120][123] The timing of the funeral allowed guests who planned to address the general debate of the UN General Assembly the following day sufficient time to fly to New York City.[120]

The day of the funeral was a bank holiday in the United Kingdom.[118][119] Many businesses, workplaces, and educational establishments closed for the day, including major supermarkets and the London Stock Exchange.[124][125][126][127] In the National Health Service several trusts chose to cancel or reschedule all non-urgent appointments.[128][129][130] Several food banks announced that they would close on the day of the funeral, though some remained open after facing public backlash.[131][132]

Hotel prices increased in the days before the funeral in London.[133] Extra train services were made available across the country to allow people to travel to and from London and pay their respects for the lying-in-state and funeral service.[134][135][136] Westminster City Council deployed its "Clean Streets" team to clean up different areas within central London.[133]

Procession to Westminster Abbey

At 10:44 on 19 September the Queen's coffin was moved from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy.[137] The carriage was drawn by Royal Navy sailors, known as Naval Ratings, maintaining a tradition which began at the state funeral of Queen Victoria.[138] The King, members of the royal family, and members of the King's household walked behind.[139][118][140] Non-working royals, including the Duke of York and the Duke of Sussex, did not wear military uniforms for the state funeral and the committal service. A wreath with foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Highgrove House, and Clarence House was placed on the coffin, together with a note from the King which read "In loving and devoted memory. Charles R."[l][141] Before the service the tenor bell of the Abbey rang once a minute for 96 minutes, once for each year of the Queen's life.[142] The coffin arrived at Westminster Abbey at 10:52.[143]

Funeral service
Music by British composers was played before the service, and as the coffin entered the abbey the choir sang the five sentences set to music.[m][142] The service began at 11:00 and was conducted by the Dean of Westminster, David Hoyle, according to the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.[145][142][146] The lessons were read by Baroness Scotland, Secretary General of the Commonwealth, and Liz Truss, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the sermon and commendation were given by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.[142][147] Prayers were said by clergy from several Christian denominations.[148][n]

The music included the psalm setting "Like as the hart" by Judith Weir and the anthem "Who shall separate us?" by James MacMillan, both written for the funeral, as well as pieces performed at the Queen's coronation and wedding.[o] The Choir of Westminster Abbey and Choir of the Chapel Royal led the singing, and were conducted by James O'Donell.[144]

The end of the service included a sounding of the "Last Post" and a two-minute silence, which was concluded with the "Reveille".[143] The National Anthem, followed by the bagpipe lament "Sleep, dearie, sleep", marked the end of the ceremony.[142] The "Allegro maestoso" from Elgar's Organ Sonata in G was played after the service.[144]

Processions in London and Windsor

Two processions followed the service. The first was from Westminster Abbey to Wellington Arch, where the Queen's coffin was placed in the state hearse. From there it was transported to Windsor, where the second procession took place through Windsor Great Park.

The procession in London began at 12:15 and included around 3,000 military personnel, stretching for over a mile. It began at the abbey and passed down Whitehall, through Horse Guards, up The Mall, past Buckingham Palace, and up Constitution Hill to end at the Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner. Around a million people lined the streets of central London to watch the event.[149]

At the front of the procession were representatives of Commonwealth forces led by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on horseback, then representatives of the Royal Air Force, the British Army, and the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, followed by defence staff and armed forces chaplains, officers of arms, and the royal household.[150] The Queen's coffin followed, again on the State Gun Carriage pulled by Royal Navy sailors, and surrounded by an escort party.[150] The King and royal family members were next, some marching and some in cars, with a further escort and the household of the former Prince of Wales behind.[150] At the rear of the procession were representatives of civilian services.[150]


The King, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Sussex, Peter Phillips, the Earl of Snowdon and the Duke of Gloucester walk behind Queen Elizabeth II's coffin. Sir Timothy Laurence was also in the procession but is not seen in this image.
Seven military bands were dispersed through the procession and again played funeral marches.[150][151] Big Ben tolled each minute and minute guns were fired from Hyde Park by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.[143] Standards were lowered and those in the procession gave salutes as they passed the Cenotaph. At Buckingham Palace, the King's Guard gave a royal salute to the Victoria Memorial and Palace staff waited outside the gates.[137][152] At Wellington Arch the coffin was transferred with a royal salute to the state hearse for the journey to Windsor.[143] The hearse left London for Windsor at 13:30, accompanied by Princess Anne and Timothy Laurence, travelling on A roads rather than motorways to allow the public to line the route.[153][154]

At 15:00 the coffin arrived in Windsor, where a final procession involving 1,000 military personnel took place down the Long Walk to St George's Chapel.[155][143] Around 97,000 people lined the route.[155][149] The Queen's fell pony, Emma, and two royal corgis, Muick and Sandy, stood at the side of the procession.[156] The King and the royal family joined the procession in the Quadrangle, during which the Sebastopol Bell and the Curfew Tower bell tolled and the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, fired minute guns from the East Lawn of the castle.[143] At the end of the procession the coffin was taken to St George's Chapel via the West Steps with the guard of honour formed by the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards.[143]

Committal service
The committal service began at 16:00 in the presence of 800 guests, largely made up of the royal household and staff from the Queen's private estates, but also including the royal family, governors general and prime ministers from the Commonwealth realms, and members of foreign royal houses.[118][143][155] The Choir of St George's Chapel led the music, which included the Russian "Kontakion of the Departed", also sung at the funeral of Prince Philip.[p][157] A selection of music was also played before the service.[157][158][q]

The Dean of Windsor, who conducted the service, read the bidding, the readings, and the commendation.[118][157][158][143] The first reading was Revelation 21, verses 1–7, which was also included in the order of service for the funerals of Elizabeth's grandparents and father.[157] The Rector of Sandringham, the Minister of Crathie Kirk and the Chaplain of Windsor Great Park delivered the prayers, and the Archbishop of Canterbury gave the concluding blessing.[143]

Near the end of the service the Imperial State Crown, orb, and sceptre were removed from the coffin and placed on the altar.[116][143][157] The King then placed the Queen's Company Camp Colour of the Grenadier Guards on his mother's coffin, before the Lord Chamberlain symbolically broke his wand of office and also placed its halves atop the coffin.[143][158] After this the Garter Principal King of Arms recited the styles of Elizabeth II and Charles III, between which a lament — "A Salute to the Royal Fendersmith" — was played by the Sovereign's Piper as the Queen's coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault. The singing of the National Anthem marked the end of the ceremony.[143][158]

Interment
After the funeral of the Queen on 19 September, she was later interred beneath the King George VI Memorial Chapel in a private service attended only by her closest family at 19:30, alongside her father King George VI, her mother Queen Elizabeth, and the ashes of her sister Princess Margaret. The remains of Prince Philip, who was temporarily interred in the Royal Vault following his funeral in 2021, were moved to the chapel after the interment of the Queen.[152][155]

Elizabeth II's coffin was constructed more than 30 years before the funeral.[159][160][r] It is made of English oak and lined with lead to protect the coffin and the remains from moisture damage. Due to the weight of the coffin, eight pallbearers were required for lifting and carrying rather than the usual six.[159][160]

Attendees

Map showing the countries from which at least one representative attended the funeral.
The service at Westminster Abbey was attended by 2,000 people in total, including holders of the George Cross and Victoria Cross, representatives from the United Kingdom's faith communities, and foreign and Commonwealth heads of state and heads of government.[142][155][161] Representatives from 168 countries, out of 193 UN member states and two UN observer states, confirmed attendance, including 18 monarchs, 55 presidents and 25 prime ministers.[155][161]

Due to the limited number of seats, foreign invitees were asked to keep their delegations as small as possible and to only bring their spouses.[162] The UK government also requested those travelling by air to use commercial flights; private flights were directed away from Heathrow Airport.[162] Additionally, the government asked guests not to use private cars to travel to Westminster Abbey, and instead use government-provided "coach transport from a central assembly point".[162] This was only guidance; leaders including the President of the United States, Joe Biden, the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, and the Vice-President of China, Wang Qishan, were taken to the event through other means.[122][163] Many dignitaries were present for a reception by the King at Buckingham Palace on the eve of the funeral, and all international guests were invited to attend a reception hosted by the Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, after the funeral service.[122][162]

Almost 200 people, recognised in the 2022 Queen's Birthday Honours for their extraordinary contributions in areas including the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, were invited to the service.[164]

Security

Police officers from Wales on duty in Sloane Square London before the funeral
Around 10,000 police officers were expected to be on duty every day in London during the mourning period, a security operation described by the Metropolitan Police as the "biggest the UK has ever seen"; officers from across the country supported the operation under mutual aid agreements.[165][166][167] Thames Valley Police announced that they would introduce new water patrols for observing busy waterways in the lead-up to the funeral, and mounted police officers, police dogs, and drones provided part of the security in Windsor.[167][168][169][170] Prior to the service a special unit, the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre, began to monitor and review individuals identified as having a potentially dangerous obsession with the British royal family.[171]

MI5 and GCHQ worked in collaboration with counter terrorism police and the Metropolitan Police to provide security for the funeral.[172] A group of 1,500 military personnel was also deployed, and Westminster was inspected by a military Wildcat helicopter.[172] "Hundreds" of stewards from private security firms were hired to aid crowd management.[172]

Cost and economic impact
HM Treasury estimated the public expenditure to have been £162 million.[173] The GDP of the United Kingdom contracted by 0.6 per cent in September 2022, attributable in part to the funeral and the period of national mourning that preceded it.[174] Graham Smith, the chief executive of pressure group Republic said, "There is an assumption that these things have to be done on this scale and that's an assumption that needs to be questioned – particularly in the middle of a cost of living crisis".[173]

Coverage
The funeral and committal service of the Queen were the first of any British monarch to be broadcast to the public.[175] Filming had been prohibited during the state funeral of George VI, although the procession of his coffin was partially televised.[176]


Temporary stands set up for broadcasters across the road from Westminster Abbey
United Kingdom
The funeral was broadcast by the BBC, ITV, and Sky, with the latter two simulcasting the service on all of their channels and not showing advertisements.[177][178][179] The BBC Two broadcast included British Sign Language interpretation.[180] BBC Radio broadcast events on Radio 2, 3, 4, 5 Live, the World Service, and its Local Radio network.[181][182][183] Global's radio brands also broadcast their own coverage.[184] Channel 4 and Channel 5 were the only major public service networks that did not air the Queen's funeral, the former airing documentary film A Queen Is Crowned, the latter airing family films such as The Emoji Movie.[185][186]

Big screens were set up at cathedrals and public areas to broadcast the service.[187] Shops, licensed establishments, parish and public halls remained open in Jersey to allow people to watch the Queen's funeral.[188]

Buckingham Palace requested that video footage did not "intrude on the grief" of individual members of the royal family, that footage of the funeral be avoided from usage on entertainment programmes and allowed only for news coverage, and that five short pieces of video featuring members of the royal family would not be broadcast again.[189]

Commonwealth and other countries
The funeral was broadcast live in Australia, The Bahamas, Canada, India, Mauritius, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and Sri Lanka.[190] The funeral was also carried live by dozens of broadcasters in most of Europe and across the world.[191][192]

Viewing figures

With an average audience of 26.5 million across more than 50 channels, the television broadcast was the second most watched broadcast during the 21st century in the United Kingdom (after the prime ministerial statement on COVID-19 during the lockdown) and the third most watched royal event in British history (surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, and approaching the weddings of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, and Princess Anne and Mark Philips).[193][194]

Upon the Queen's death, her eldest child Charles, Prince of Wales, immediately acceded to the British throne as King Charles III.[46][195]

There was some speculation regarding the regnal name that would be adopted by the former Prince of Wales upon succeeding his mother. During her formal televised address outside 10 Downing Street, Prime Minister Liz Truss made the first mention of the King's regnal name during a tribute to the Queen.[196] Clarence House officially confirmed the new king would be known as Charles III shortly after the Prime Minister's address. Buckingham Palace released the King's first official statement as monarch at 19:04:

The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.

We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.
